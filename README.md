# Strive-FS-M3-D10-Benchmark
 
Project based on Netflix project from Strive-FS-M2-D5 repository. 
Code was revised and improved wherever possible.

It adds back office to the previous project and makes the project responsive using APIs.

Features:
- Movies generated dynamically using API
- Movies can be added to API via backoffice
- Movies can be edited via backoffice
- Movies can be deleted via backoffice

Important Notice: Every request to the API uses Strive-generated Token Based Authentication to secure access to the contents. Tokens duration is set to 14 days. Therefore this project might not work properly after a while, if the headers are not updated in the meantime.
